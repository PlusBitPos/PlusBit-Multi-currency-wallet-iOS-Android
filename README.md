# Backing up PlusBit Portfolio
PlusBit uses your username & password to generate your addresses and access funds. Your username + password is your backup phrase. Don't share it with anyone! A single different character in username or password will create a different set of addresses (e.g. a capitalization, space, order of numbers, etc.). Ensure you secure your **EXACT** username + password to access your account. Store in a secure location. This is your only backup option to restore PlusBit.

There are individual private keys in WIF (wallet import format) for each asset. Back up each WIF private key that holds assets to maximum protection. Go to **Settings** tab, click the **Private Keys**, print your backup document and **store securely**.

As a results, **it is the responsibility of the user to properly manage their credentials.** If they are lost, it is not possible to access your account. Again, this is why it is a good idea to back up this data in a safe place. If you don’t own your private keys, you don’t own your bitcoins or any other altcoin. So even if you lose your password and username, you can recover your money with your private key.
